# BookLogger

## Description

The foundation for this project was provided by an online bootcamp for [Full-Stack Development](https://bootcamps.vanderbilt.edu/coding/online/landing/). 

This project focused on migrating from a RESTful API to a GraphQL setup.

## What I Did

I started this project by working on the backend, setting up the apollo server and GraphQL interface. After that I built the required resolvers and typeDefs so I could test them. Once I was done with the backend I moved on to the front end working on the mutations and queries first. After those were setup I integrated them into the application so I could properly test and verify that everything was linked up and working.
